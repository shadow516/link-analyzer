# link-analyzer

Before using this application:

1- This app is prepared for users who use chrome or dont have the wayback machine downloader.
2- You dont need to download an entire site to take the links of it.
3- This app doesnt took the links of a site, the link analyzer symplifies the links for now. In the future, will organize those links, filter them and much more!
4- An extension for chrome that i use to pick up the links is this one: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/link-grabber/caodelkhipncidmoebgbbeemedohcdma?hl=es&utm_source=ext_sidebar ***REMEMBER TO PIN THE EXTENSION***
5- When having this extension, enter a site or thread you want to pick up the links, click the extension, and you'll have all your links.

USING THE APPLICATION

**This app works (for now) only when the links where taken from the web archive**
You'll need to use the date where the wayback machine store (Ex: https://web.archive.org/web/20220302070152/... -> **20220302070152**)

The link analyzer has 2 options:

1- One by one: Symplifies a link one by one. Useful if you just want to test some links.

2- Multiple links: Symplifies a big amount of links. This one is a bit difficult, but its easy when you understand it:

- With the link Grabber (the google extension), copy all the links with the "Copy" button.
- Then, create a .txt file, and paste it on the text file. Make sure to put the file on the same directory as the Link Analyzer's folder.
- Select the Multiple Link's option, enter the date of the web archive, and then the file's name.
- When the program finish proccessing the links, it'll create a file named "Links.txt", and here you'll have all your links.

Any question ask me on discord :D
